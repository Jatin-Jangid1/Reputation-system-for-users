# Reputation System

## Project Description
The Reputation System is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain to manage and track user reputation based on feedback received from others. It allows users to provide reputation scores to others while ensuring fairness and preventing self-rating or duplicate feedback.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized and tamper-proof reputation management system that can be integrated into various blockchain-based applications, including marketplaces, freelancing platforms, and social networks. It aims to provide a transparent and immutable way to assess credibility and trustworthiness.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Reputation Tracking**: Users' reputation scores are stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Fair Feedback Mechanism**: Users can give reputation scores to others, but not to themselves.
- **Prevention of Duplicate Feedback**: A user can only provide feedback once to another user.
- **Reputation Calculation**: Reputation is calculated as a weighted average of all received feedback scores.
- **Event Logging**: Updates in reputation scores trigger an event for transparency and auditability.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with DApps**: The reputation system can be integrated with decentralized applications for better trust assessment.
- **Reputation Decay Mechanism**: Implement a system where older feedback has less impact on reputation.
- **Feedback Removal or Appeal System**: Users may be able to contest unfair feedback through a governance model.
- **Incorporation of Additional Factors**: Other variables such as on-chain activity and interactions could contribute to reputation scores.
- **Multi-chain Compatibility**: Expanding the contract to work across multiple blockchain networks.

## How to Use
1. Deploy the contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Use the `giveFeedback` function to provide a reputation score to another user.
3. Query a user’s reputation score using the `getReputation` funtion
